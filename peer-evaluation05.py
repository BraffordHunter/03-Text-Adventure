Project: Text Adventure
Peer's repository: https://github.com/BraffordHunter/03-Text-adventure



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
    With the format we used for the project, the use of parenthesis can get pretty complicated. I better learned the usage of
    commas and parenthesis to maintain format. 
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
    I like that he used specific commands, such as GO INTO DESERT, instead of simple directions. This makes the game more
    creative and interesting. I would like to apply that same creativity to my own projects. 
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
    Due to the formatting, the .json file does not work correctly with the code in main.py. In the next project, my peer may
    need to pay moer attention to the fine details of the json file, which houses the rooms and exits. It appears that the 
    parenthesis in this file may be incorrect. A lot of the JSON locations have targets which do not currently exist, which
    could be fixed if my peer added the rest of the targets that it appears they intended to add. 

 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
    For the player, there does not appear to be clear instructions about what you must enter to move forward in the game. 

 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
    The code in main.py appears to be pretty clear. the only errors seem to be in the json file. Here, there are targets that
    don't exist in the code and the commands are not referenced in the beginning. 

 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
    There is no license in the file. 

 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
    The README.md could contain instructions about which words to enter in order to move forward or could describe the
    purpose of the json file. 

 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
    the main.py code is very clear and easy to follow. It appears you have deleted all unnecessary lines from the given skeleton code,
    which makes the main file very clear cut.
