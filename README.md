# 03-Text-Adventure
The first text adventure
This is a new text adventure that I am creating from the json file. At least seven or eight scenes. See lines 12-38 for example of correct room. Connect with exits lines 15-36. Every verb in the exits list needs to be in verbs list in lines 2-9. Use link of validator in canvas to check.
All of this is in Zork,jason for the references.
